# WalkWithMe

--------
This is the GitHub structure for portfolio assignment 1

+ The release branch is branched from development branch before getting merged into main branch. This allows us to-fine tune and control the code.

+ The development branch combines front-end and back-end of the app

+ The frontend merges all front-end and UI related functions

+ The frontend merges all back-end related functionalities

+ The hotfix branch are used for all occurring errors on the main branch. This needs to be fixed immediately
